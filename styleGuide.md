# coding style followed 


> [!NOTE]
> The primary goal is to explain concepts rather than focusing on implementation details. Therefore, we choose not to use setters and getters to access class data members. This approach keeps the code concise and directs attention to the core ideas being discussed.

- class name should be written in PascalCasee
```cpp
class LinkedList
```

----
 
- functions and variable names should be written in camelCase
ex:
```cpp
void isEmpty() const;
int newData;
```

----

- pointers should end with ptr to make it clear
```cpp
Node* headPtr;
Node* frontPtr;
```

-----

- curly braces placed a new line
```cpp
function
{
  //function body
}
```

----
