# coding style followed 

coding style followed to make everything consistent

- class name should be written in pascal case
  
```cpp
class LinkedList
```

----
 
- functions and variable names should be written in camelcase
ex:
```cpp
void isEmpty() const;
int newData;
```

----

- pointers should end with ptr to make it clear
```cpp
Node* headPtr;
Node* frontPtr;
```

-----

- curly braces placed a new line
```cpp
function
{
  //function body
}
```

----
