## Formal definitions 
*Recursive call* : A method call in which the method being called is the same as the one making the call.  <br />
*Direct recursion* : Recursion in which a method directly calls itself.  <br />
*Indirect recursion* : Recursion in which a chain of two or more method calls returns to the method that originated the chain.  <br />
*Tail recursion* : The case in which a function contains only a single recursive call and it is the last statement to be executed in the function.  <br />

## general format
```C++
if(SomeKnownCondition)  //base case
   SolutionStatement;
else
   RecursiveFunctionCall;  //general case
```
